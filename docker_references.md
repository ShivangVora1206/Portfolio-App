# 🐳 Docker common references 🐳

👇 Here are some common docker commands for quick reference

## REFERENCES 📓
### Creating a docker image 📷
#### 1. Create a Dockerfile in the local project directory
Example:
```
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY build/ /app/build

RUN npm install -g serve

CMD ["serve", "-s", "build", "-l", "3000"]

EXPOSE 3000
```
#### 2. Create a docker image
#### `docker image build [OPTIONS] PATH | URL | -`
Example:
```
docker image build -t shivang-vora-portfolio:1.0.1 .
```
#### 3. Run a docker image as a container

#### `docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]`
Example:
```
docker run -p 3000:3000 shivang-vora-portfolio:1.0.1
```

--- These were the steps required for a basic docker based implemetation to create a dockerfile, build an image and run a container ---

### Pushing an image to Docker Hub 📤

#### 1. Create a docker hub account
#### 2. Create a repo on docker hub
#### 2.5. If you haven't previously run docker login on your system you need to run it
Example:
```
docker login
```
#### 3. After building the image on your local system tag it with your username/repo:tag
#### `docker tag SOURCE_IMAGE[:TAG] TARGET_IMAGE[:TAG]`
Example:
```
docker image tag shivang-vora-portfolio:1.0.1 uchihaitachi12/shivang-vora-portfolio:1.0.1
```

#### 4.Push the image to hub 
#### `docker push [OPTIONS] NAME[:TAG]`
Example:
```
docker image push uchihaitachi12/shivang-vora-portfolio:1.0.1
```

--------- These were the steps required for pushing your image to your repo on Docker Hub --------

### Pulling an image from Docker Hub 📥

#### 1. Pull an image from docker hub
#### `docker pull [OPTIONS] NAME[:TAG|@DIGEST]`
Example:
```
docker pull uchihaitachi12/shivang-vora-portfolio:1.0.0
```

#### 2. Run the docker container and map any local port to the port you exposed in your docker file

#### `docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]`
Example:
```
docker run  -p 3000:3000 -d uchihaitachi12/shivang-vora-portfolio:1.0.0
```
Here, in `-p 3000:3000` the first port number indicates a port of your local system and \
the second port indicates the port of the docker container that you want to connect to. \
We want to connect to the port of the container that is exposed (written in the docker file) and expecting a connection.
